By identifying at-risk customers in advance, businesses can take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.
The project includes;
Data Collection: Import dataset (CSV / SQL / API).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions, churn rates, and feature importance.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical values.

Modeling:

Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
